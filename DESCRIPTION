Package: stevedore
Title: Docker Client
Version: 0.0.5
Description: Work with containers over the Docker 'API'.  Rather than
    using system calls to interact with a docker client, using the
    'API' directly means that we can recieve richer information from
    docker.  The interface in the package is automatically generated
    using the 'OpenAPI' (a.k.a., 'swagger') specification, and all
    return values are checked in order to make them type stable.
